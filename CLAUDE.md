# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## Project: GardenLog

An AI-powered garden task logging app built with Laravel 13 + Blade + Tailwind CSS 4. Users log garden tasks (watering, fertilizing, planting) and query their history via natural-language AI search (Claude API). See [`context/foundation/prd.md`](context/foundation/prd.md) for full requirements.

## Commands

```bash
# Full initial setup (install deps, .env, app key, migrate, npm install, build)
composer setup

# Start all dev processes (Laravel server + queue + logs + Vite) via concurrently
composer dev

# Run tests (clears config cache first, uses SQLite :memory:)
composer test

# Run a single test file or filter
php artisan test --filter=SomeTestName
php artisan test tests/Feature/ExampleTest.php

# Code style (Laravel Pint)
./vendor/bin/pint

# Frontend only
npm run dev
npm run build
```

## Artisan CLI — first-class tool for file generation

**Always prefer `php artisan make:*` over manually creating files.** Before writing any Laravel class by hand, check whether an Artisan generator exists for it.

Common generators:

| Task | Command |
| --- | --- |
| Controller | `php artisan make:controller NameController` |
| Model (+ migration) | `php artisan make:model Name -m` |
| Migration | `php artisan make:migration create_name_table` |
| Middleware | `php artisan make:middleware NameMiddleware` |
| Request (Form Request) | `php artisan make:request NameRequest` |
| Seeder | `php artisan make:seeder NameSeeder` |
| Factory | `php artisan make:factory NameFactory` |
| Job | `php artisan make:job NameJob` |
| Event / Listener | `php artisan make:event Name` / `php artisan make:listener Name` |
| Mail | `php artisan make:mail NameMail` |
| Notification | `php artisan make:notification NameNotification` |
| Policy | `php artisan make:policy NamePolicy` |
| Resource (API) | `php artisan make:resource NameResource` |
| Command | `php artisan make:command NameCommand` |
| Service Provider | `php artisan make:provider NameServiceProvider` |
| Test | `php artisan make:test NameTest` |

Run `php artisan list make` to see the full up-to-date list. When unsure, check that list before creating any file manually.

## Architecture

**Entry points:**
- `routes/web.php` — all web routes (Blade-rendered)
- `routes/api.php` — REST API routes (not yet created)

**Data layer:**
- Default SQLite in dev (`database/database.sqlite`); MySQL 8.0 via Docker (`docker-compose.yml`, port 3307)
- Tests use SQLite `:memory:` (configured in `phpunit.xml`)
- Sessions, cache, and queue all use the `database` driver

**Frontend:**
- Blade templates in `resources/views/`
- Tailwind CSS v4 via `@tailwindcss/vite` — no `tailwind.config.js`; config lives inside `resources/css/app.css` using CSS custom properties
- Vite bundles `resources/js/app.js` and `resources/css/app.css`

**Docker:**
- `docker-compose.yml` runs app (PHP-FPM), Nginx (port 8001), and MySQL
- Use `composer dev` for local dev without Docker (uses built-in PHP server via `artisan serve`)

**Context/foundation contracts** (read before planning features):
- [`context/foundation/prd.md`](context/foundation/prd.md) — product requirements
- [`context/foundation/tech-stack.md`](context/foundation/tech-stack.md) — tech stack decisions
- [`context/foundation/shape-notes.md`](context/foundation/shape-notes.md) — scoping constraints

## 10xDevs AI Toolkit - Module 2, Lesson 3

Review AI-generated code before merge with the **implementation review chain**:

```
/10x-implement -> /10x-impl-review -> triage -> (/10x-lesson | fix | skip | disagree)
```

`/10x-impl-review` is the lesson focus. Review is a quality gate, not an instruction to fix every finding.

### Task Router - Where to start

| Skill | Use it when |
| --- | --- |
| **Code review (lesson focus)** | |
| `/10x-impl-review <change-id>` | You have implemented code and want a structured review before merge. The skill checks plan adherence, scope discipline, safety and quality, architecture, pattern consistency, and success criteria, then presents findings for triage. |
| **Recurring lesson outcome** | |
| `/10x-lesson` | A finding reveals a recurring project rule or agent failure pattern. Record it in `context/foundation/lessons.md` instead of treating it as a one-off note. |

### Triage discipline

- Severity says how bad the finding is. Impact says how much the decision matters now.
- Valid outcomes: fix now, fix differently, skip, accept as risk, record as recurring rule (`/10x-lesson`), disagree.
- Fix critical findings. Do not burn hours on low-impact observations just because the agent found them.
- Conscious skipping of low-impact findings is a valid review outcome, not negligence.
- If you disagree with a finding, record why. Wrong agent reasoning is also signal.

### Review boundaries

- This lesson reviews implemented code. It does not create the plan, execute new phases, or teach CI review.
- Testing strategy and quality gates are introduced in Module 3.
- Do not use `/10x-contract` as a triage outcome in this lesson.

### Paths used by this lesson

- `context/changes/<change-id>/plan.md` - expected implementation contract
- `context/changes/<change-id>/reviews/` - review output
- `context/foundation/lessons.md` - recurring lessons

Skills must not write to `context/archive/`. Archived changes are immutable; if a resolved target path starts with `context/archive/`, abort with: "This change is archived. Open a new change with `/10x-new` instead."
