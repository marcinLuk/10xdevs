# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## Project: GardenLog

An AI-powered garden task logging app built with Laravel 13 + Blade + Tailwind CSS 4. Users log garden tasks (watering, fertilizing, planting) and query their history via natural-language AI search (Claude API). See [`context/foundation/prd.md`](context/foundation/prd.md) for full requirements.

## Commands

```bash
# Full initial setup (install deps, .env, app key, migrate, npm install, build)
composer setup

# Start all dev processes (Laravel server + queue + logs + Vite) via concurrently
composer dev

# Run tests (clears config cache first, uses SQLite :memory:)
composer test

# Run a single test file or filter
php artisan test --filter=SomeTestName
php artisan test tests/Feature/ExampleTest.php

# Code style (Laravel Pint)
./vendor/bin/pint

# Frontend only
npm run dev
npm run build
```

## Artisan CLI — first-class tool for file generation

**Always prefer `php artisan make:*` over manually creating files.** Before writing any Laravel class by hand, check whether an Artisan generator exists for it.

Common generators:

| Task | Command |
| --- | --- |
| Controller | `php artisan make:controller NameController` |
| Model (+ migration) | `php artisan make:model Name -m` |
| Migration | `php artisan make:migration create_name_table` |
| Middleware | `php artisan make:middleware NameMiddleware` |
| Request (Form Request) | `php artisan make:request NameRequest` |
| Seeder | `php artisan make:seeder NameSeeder` |
| Factory | `php artisan make:factory NameFactory` |
| Job | `php artisan make:job NameJob` |
| Event / Listener | `php artisan make:event Name` / `php artisan make:listener Name` |
| Mail | `php artisan make:mail NameMail` |
| Notification | `php artisan make:notification NameNotification` |
| Policy | `php artisan make:policy NamePolicy` |
| Resource (API) | `php artisan make:resource NameResource` |
| Command | `php artisan make:command NameCommand` |
| Service Provider | `php artisan make:provider NameServiceProvider` |
| Test | `php artisan make:test NameTest` |

Run `php artisan list make` to see the full up-to-date list. When unsure, check that list before creating any file manually.

## Architecture

**Entry points:**
- `routes/web.php` — all web routes (Blade-rendered)
- `routes/api.php` — REST API routes (not yet created)

**Data layer:**
- Default SQLite in dev (`database/database.sqlite`); MySQL 8.0 via Docker (`docker-compose.yml`, port 3307)
- Tests use SQLite `:memory:` (configured in `phpunit.xml`)
- Sessions, cache, and queue all use the `database` driver

**Frontend:**
- Blade templates in `resources/views/`
- Tailwind CSS v4 via `@tailwindcss/vite` — no `tailwind.config.js`; config lives inside `resources/css/app.css` using CSS custom properties
- Vite bundles `resources/js/app.js` and `resources/css/app.css`

**Docker:**
- `docker-compose.yml` runs app (PHP-FPM), Nginx (port 8001), and MySQL
- Use `composer dev` for local dev without Docker (uses built-in PHP server via `artisan serve`)

**Context/foundation contracts** (read before planning features):
- [`context/foundation/prd.md`](context/foundation/prd.md) — product requirements
- [`context/foundation/tech-stack.md`](context/foundation/tech-stack.md) — tech stack decisions
- [`context/foundation/shape-notes.md`](context/foundation/shape-notes.md) — scoping constraints

## 10xDevs AI Toolkit - Module 2, Lesson 4

Prepare for a harder implementation stream with the **research-backed planning chain**:

```
internal research (/10x-research) + external research (exa.ai, Context7) -> /10x-plan -> /10x-implement -> success
```

The lesson focus is distinguishing internal from external research and using evidence to back planning decisions.

### Task Router - Where to start

| Skill | Use it when |
| --- | --- |
| **Internal research (lesson focus)** | |
| `/10x-research <change-id>` | You need evidence from the existing codebase — patterns, conventions, integration points, or existing implementations. Runs parallel sub-agents over the repo and writes structured findings to `research.md`. |
| **External research (lesson focus)** | |
| exa.ai | You need AI-native web search for library comparisons, best practices, or ecosystem context that the codebase cannot answer. |
| Context7 (`resolve-library-id` → `get-library-docs`) | You need live, current documentation for a specific library or framework. Resolves a library ID first, then fetches relevant doc pages. |
| **Framing spare wheel** | |
| `/10x-frame <change-id>` | The plan won't converge, the plan doesn't deliver expected results, or persistent drift keeps breaking the implementation. Use as an escape hatch on a separate problem (demonstrated on Space Explorers example), not as pre-research ritual. |
| **Planning and execution** | |
| `/10x-plan <change-id>` / `/10x-implement <change-id> phase <n>` | Use the same planning and execution chain from Lesson 2, now with upstream research evidence feeding the plan. |

### Research discipline

- Internal research (`/10x-research`) answers "what does our codebase already do?" — patterns, schemas, conventions, integration points.
- External research (exa.ai, Context7) answers "what should we do?" — library capabilities, API docs, ecosystem best practices.
- Combine both as evidence-backed input to `/10x-plan`. A plan without research evidence on a non-trivial stream is a guess.
- Agent-friendly docs (`llms.txt`, markdown-for-agents, `/md` endpoints) are a quality signal for library selection — libraries that publish agent-readable docs integrate faster.

### `/10x-frame` as spare wheel

Three triggers for reaching for `/10x-frame`:
1. The plan won't converge — research keeps opening more questions instead of narrowing to a contract.
2. The plan doesn't deliver — implementation repeatedly fails to meet success criteria.
3. Persistent drift — the implementation keeps diverging from the plan in ways that suggest the problem was mis-framed.

Demonstrated on a Space Explorers example, not the SRS path. It is an escape hatch, not a mandatory step.

### Paths used by this lesson

- `context/changes/<change-id>/research.md` - internal research output
- `context/changes/<change-id>/frame.md` - framing output when needed
- `context/changes/<change-id>/plan.md` - evidence-backed implementation contract
- `context/foundation/lessons.md` - recurring rules and pitfalls

Skills must not write to `context/archive/`. Archived changes are immutable; if a resolved target path starts with `context/archive/`, abort with: "This change is archived. Open a new change with `/10x-new` instead."
